# FB Menus

Online menus for hotel restaurants and cafés: guests scan a QR code, managers update dishes, prices and availability live.
One codebase serves every outlet.

- **Guest menu:** static pages on GitHub Pages. Arabic and English (French ready). Loads the whole menu in one request of about 9 KB, keeps a copy for weak Wi-Fi, works offline.
- **Admin:** `/admin/`, for phone or tablet. Dishes, prices, sold-out switch, drag-to-reorder, photos, allergens, choices, serving hours and buffet prices.
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage). Row-level security gives guests read-only access and lets admins edit only their own outlet.
